# IoT-Based-Drainage-Monitoring-System
For making a smart city one needs to consider many parameters such as smart water, smart electricity, smart transportation etc. 
There will be a need of smart underground infrastructure which includes underground water pipelines, communication cables, gas pipelines, electric flow, etc. 
As most of the cities in India have adopted underground drainage system, it is very important that this system should work in a proper manner to keep the city clean, safe and healthy. 
If they fail to maintain the drainage system the pure water may get contaminated with drainage water and can spread infectious diseases. 
So different kind of work has been done to detect, maintain and manage these underground systems. 
This project represents the implementation and design functions for monitoring and managing underground drainage system with different approaches using Internet of Things.

This is the final year project done by three members of B.Tech (2019 PO) of **Electronics & Communication Engineering Department, Siliguri Institute of Technology.**

**1) Neelesh Biswas.
**2) Agrapriya Das.
**3) Durba Sarkar.
